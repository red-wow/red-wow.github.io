    <h1>An Explanation of the Hannah (Hannvh1) Situation</h1>

    <p>Hello Washiez. By now, most of you are likely aware of the Hannah situation. For those who are not, this is a detailed summary of the events that unfolded.</p>

    <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
    <p>On <strong>August 24, 2025</strong>, at 6:00 PM EST, Washiez announced its new Chief Operating Officer (COO): <strong>WickDr</strong>. Immediately following this announcement, <strong>Hannah (Hannvh1)</strong> left the Washiez group, Discord server, and cleared her connections entirely. This swift departure suggests she had been expecting the COO position herself, which she did not receive.</p>

    <p>Hannah had been a Head Corporate in OPD for approximately six months, significantly longer than WickDr’s tenure. Seniority is a critical factor when selecting leadership positions, but it appears to have been disregarded here.</p>

    <h2>Why Wasn’t Hannah Chosen?</h2>
    <p>Hannah was widely recognized for her activity and dedication. She consistently hosted Mass Shifts, engaged with the community, and demonstrated leadership qualities. WickDr was also qualified, but based on available data, Hannah’s record was stronger.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Choosing the next chief is the decision of Bella (utwpia, Chief Administrative Officer), Magik (TheMagikMan12, Vice Chairman), Dev (Deviizer, Chairman), and the current or former chief of the department.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Internal sources claim that Dev supported Hannah for COO, but Bella strongly opposed this choice and pushed for WickDr. The reasoning for this remains unknown. Screenshots supporting this claim exist, but they are redacted to protect whistleblower identities.</p>

    <h3>Bella’s Public Response</h3>
    <p>Bella’s reaction to community support for Hannah was widely perceived as dismissive and unprofessional. Supervision Team members who voiced their opinions were muted for 24 hours. Her announcement — thanking Hannah but quickly pivoting to a “don’t cause drama” stance — felt insincere and minimized Hannah’s contributions. Most messages in support of Hannah were peaceful, not disruptive.</p>

    <h2>Community and Staff Backlash</h2>
    <p>Hannah’s departure sparked outrage from staff, community members, and even trollers, who largely sided with her. In response, Washiez leadership began moderating mentions of Hannah:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Muting members for 24+ hours for messages as simple as “Justice for Hannah.” At least 15 users were muted, likely more.</li>
      <li>Targeting Supervision Team members and former staff showing support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Abuse of Power Allegations</h3>
    <p>Specific incidents of misconduct emerged:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Liam (2liiam, Chief Public Relations Officer)</strong> removed <strong>Pawsilla’s</strong> Former Management role without justification, replying with only “Self explanatory.” This action was unprofessional and outside his jurisdiction; only HRD is authorized to manage such roles.</li>
      <li><strong>TokyoLightszz</strong>’s Former Corporate role was revoked for “Toxicity” after showing support for Hannah. She was also warned.</li>
      <li><strong>Svegliant1</strong>, a former OPD Corporate, was muted for 24 hours for expressing support for Hannah.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Leadership’s tone toward critics was described as unprofessional, dismissive, and “cowardly.” The behavior of Washiez chiefs has been heavily criticized as lacking accountability and decorum.</p>

    <h2>Resignations in Solidarity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1Zackary</strong>, a Junior Director, resigned in direct support of Hannah.</li>
      <li><strong>SpireaIm</strong> and <strong>waffIestomping</strong>, both corporates, resigned shortly afterward. While not explicitly tied to the situation, it is widely believed to be related.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Leadership framed Hannah’s departure as a simple resignation, which downplays the severity of her actions — she fully left everything, signaling frustration and disappointment with leadership decisions.</p>

    <h2>Hannah’s Response</h2>
    <p>Hannah briefly joined Washiez’s main game to greet members and reassure the community, despite the backlash. She downplayed the situation, avoiding further drama, but supporters insist her treatment was unjust and demoralizing.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of This Report</h2>
    <p>This document was written to shed light on leadership issues in Washiez and advocate for fairness in promotions and decision-making. It is not a call for anyone to step down but a request for better oversight by Dev and Magik. These events highlight systemic problems that should not be repeated.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the future of Washiez leadership lies with the executive team. Decisions about Bella’s continued role as CAO and promotion protocols should be made with fairness and transparency in mind.</p>
